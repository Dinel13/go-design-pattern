proxy identical with decorator

proxy tries to provide an identical interface;
decorator provide an enhanced interface

decorator need what it wants to decorate, so it needs their pointer 

so to use proxy is to implement the existing interface then add relevant functionality to the method then forward it to the real function

proxy can use in different place, like communication, logging, caching, etc
